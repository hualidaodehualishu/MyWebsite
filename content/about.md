Hi, this is my Blog. my name is Xuan Zhou. I am currently a master student at the Institute Polytechnic de Paris. I am interested in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

I have done a few different course projects, you can open my GitHub on:

##PROJECTS
###Travel recommendation robot 2022/11 - Now
1. The CNN model is currently being used to train on an emotion datasets, which are containing seven emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutrality.
2. Loading the trained model on the robot.
3. During the conversation between the user and the robot, the robot adjusts the travel destination recommendations by recognizing the user’s facial expressions in the displayed images of the travel des- tinations.
Transversal Project in M2 2022/10 - Now 1. currently building a model for 3D object detection based on deep learning.
 
2. The plan is to use Lidar to collect 3D point cloud data to build my own datasets and use it for model validation.
3. Deploy the model on a virtual reality platform to see the test results through VR glasses.
###Marker-based augmented reality 2022/09 - 2022/11 1. augmented reality is implemented on images.
2. implemented augmented reality on video streams.
3. Implemented feature extraction on SIFT, SURF and ORB.
4. Implemented feature matching on Brute Force Matcher and KNN.
5. Determined to use ORB for image descriptor grabbing and BFM for descriptor matching by com- paring the computation time and matching success rate.
###Artificial Intelligence course projects 2022/04 - 2022/06
1. AI’s course projects, which are including 1) designing a simple linear classifier able to automatically predict the label for unseen data applied as input to the system. 2) Handwritten digit classification using ANN / CNN. 3) Clothing classification using CNN. 4) Cats/Dogs classification using a reduced training dataset.
2. Implement a model for image captioning task from an input image to generate a text describing the image.
###Computer graphic course projects 2022/09 - 2022/11 1. Mastered Blender and built character models.
2. Mastered Unity and built a snow collecting game with gold coins.
Leukocyte Classification 2022/04 - 2022/08 1. Read papers on leukocyte classification and learned different methods to classify leukocytes.
2. A CNN model from scratch was built to classify leukocytes.
3. Built the ResNeXt50 model applied to the task of leukocyte classification.
4. Considering apply advanced model in this task, such as transformer and Swin transformer.
###Scientific Project on Machine Learning
1. Implemented KNN, CNN, Random Forest on cifar10 for image classification.
2. By changing the architecture of CNN to improve the performance of CNN.
3. Constructed transfer learning in VGG16, ResNet50 and InceptionV3 on cifar10. 4. Analyzed error of results.
